Disclaimer: This project is from the course "The complete Javascript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!". I do not claim ownership of this project. Also, the course is focused on Javascript; hence, all the css are provided as a course resource.

About: This is a recipe searching application where we can also create our own recipes and bookmark recipes.

Description: The API used for the recipes is created by the author of the course, Jonas Schmedtmann. In this project we have used the local storage to store our bookmarked recipes. We have also used the ASYNC/AWAIT javascript features to fetch the data from the recipe API.
